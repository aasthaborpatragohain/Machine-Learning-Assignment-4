# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* classifier on the classic *Iris dataset* using *Python* and *scikit-learn. It also includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of accuracy for different values of *k (number of neighbors).
